                <h2>Titanium</h2>
                <p>
                    Titanium is considered to be the hardest and lightest metal on our planet. 
                    This metal is actively used in aviation and shipbuilding — 
                    the material is excellent for the manufacture of aircraft and ship hulls. 
                    By the way, bulletproof vests are made of titanium.

                <h2>Uranium</h2>
                <p>
                    The only metal that can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors is uranium. 
                    Many people consider it very dangerous because of its high radioactivity. 
                    However, natural uranium is safe for human health, and its variety called U-235 
                    is dangerous — it is used in nuclear reactors.

                <h2>Francium</h2>
                <p>
                    Francium is the rarest metal. According to scientists, its concentration 
                    in the earth's crust is only 340 grams. Francium is very radioactive, at the moment 
                    it is not used anywhere. However, varieties of France are used in 
                    the course of scientific research.
